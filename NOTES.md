## 📁 Phase 01 – Project Structure (WIP)

### ✅ TODO
- [ ] Create base folder structure: `components/`, `pages/`, `styles/`
- [ ] Create `Home.jsx` placeholder page
- [ ] Create and commit `.gitignore` (if missing)
- [ ] Add `NOTES.md` to Git
- [ ] (Optional) Set up path aliases in `vite.config.js`

### 🛠 Structure Ideas
- Keep shared layout components in `components/layout/`
- Use `pages/` for top-level routes only
- Place `base.css` in `styles/` and import into `main.jsx`
