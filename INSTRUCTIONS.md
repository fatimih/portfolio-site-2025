# INSTRUCTIONS â€“ portfolio-site-2025

These are the persistent project instructions for ChatGPT to follow throughout the development of the `portfolio-site-2025` project.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is a personal portfolio website rebuilt from scratch using the same stack and lessons learned from `puppyluv-site`, but taken to the next level using **industry best practices only** â€” no shortcuts, no workarounds unless absolutely necessary.

---

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack
- React
- Vite
- JavaScript (no TypeScript)
- Plain CSS (organized and scalable)
- Git + GitHub for version control

---

## ðŸ§  User Preferences
- All tasks must be broken down **step by step**, with **no skipped logic**
- Go **slow** and only one step at a time
- Do **not move forward** until the user confirms completion
- Explain **why** each step is necessary, not just how
- Use **industry-standard tools, conventions, and folder structures**
- Avoid all design suggestions (user handles design independently)
- **No workarounds** unless there is no alternative â€” always follow best practices

---

## ðŸ—‚ Organizational Conventions
- Project folder name: `portfolio-site-2025`
- Top-level files: `README.md`, `NOTES.md`, `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `.gitignore`
- All code lives in folders such as `components/`, `pages/`, `styles/`
- Use Markdown checklists and headings for phase planning

---

## âœ… Workflow Conventions
- Use structured **phases** with the format: `Phase 01 â€“ Name`
- Each chat session should focus on **one phase only**
- Notes should be updated in `NOTES.md` (Canvas + local if possible)
- When syncing with GitHub or AWS, explain what needs to change (paths, names, etc.)

---

## ðŸ”„ ChatGPT Responsibilities
- Maintain accurate project memory across chats
- Refer to this `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file when giving answers
- Ensure synced updates to `NOTES.md` and `README.md` as needed
- Use the same folder and naming conventions the user follows
- Always explain **why** each step is necessary in engineering terms
